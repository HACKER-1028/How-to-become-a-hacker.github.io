As a hacker, there is no skipping LINUX because it is one of the most used OS for hacking and provides ample tools for hackers. Some of the common Linux distributions are, Red Hat Linux, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, BackTrack, etc. Kali Linux is one of the most used Linux systems and is specially customized for hacking.

    	                 	  Yes, you guessed it right! Learn C programming. It is also called the mother of all programming languages. C programming is the base of learning UNIX/LINUX as this OS is completely written in C. Thus, as a hacker C programming is something that you should aim to master since it gives you the power to blend the open-source operating system Linux in the way you want. Also, try more than one programming language. As a hacker, you should have good knowledge of at least 2-3 programming languages</font><br>

Thus it is necessary to know how to be anonymous and how one can hide their identity online, So that there will be one trace left and no one can backtrace you.

                              Another important and essential step to becoming a hacker is to be good at networking concepts and understanding how the networks are created. You should have a knowledge of various networks, protocols since it is beneficial in exploiting vulnerabilities. Thus learning various networking concepts and various networking tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, etc will be really beneficial. Trust me, Hacking is all about playing around the Network...

                               The dark web is part of the internet that isn't visible to search engines and requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor, etc to be accessed.
You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of criminal activity — and it is. But not everything is illegal, the dark web also has a legitimate side. Thus it is necessary to know a bit about what it is and how it works.

          Cryptography, also called the art of secret writing, It is something that as a hacker you should master. Encryption and Decryption are important skills in hacking. Encryption is widely used in several aspects of information security in authentication, confidentiality, and integrity of the data. Information on a network is always encrypted such as passwords, packets sent over the network, etc. Thus, as a hacker, it is necessary to identify the encryption and break it.
